##Avoiding Syntax Errors with strings:
#python confusing single quotes with apostrophe.
message = "One of Python's strengths is its diverse community"
print(message)
#no problem with is line since the apostrophe is within the string.

#If a single quote syntax is used:
message = 'One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.'
#Interesting this line did give rise to an error.
